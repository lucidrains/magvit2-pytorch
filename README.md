## MagViT2 - Pytorch

Implementation of MagViT2 from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737">Language Model Beats Diffusion - Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</a> in Pytorch. This currently holds SOTA for video generation / understanding.

The Lookup Free Quantizer proposed in the paper can be found in a <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/vector-quantize-pytorch/blob/master/vector_quantize_pytorch/lookup_free_quantization.py">separate repository</a>. It should probably be explored for all other modalities, starting with <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/audiolm-pytorch/commit/c748fcdb565964bc562277bd73fbeb2e5df0ffca">audio</a>

Update: Tencent has used the code in this repository and <a href="https://github.com/TencentARC/Open-MAGVIT2">open sourced a working model</a>

## Appreciation

- <a href="https://stability.ai/">StabilityAI</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/">ðŸ¤— Huggingface</a> for the generous sponsorship, as well as my other sponsors, for affording me the independence to open source artificial intelligence.

- <a href="https://github.com/LouisSerrano">Louis Serrano</a> for sharing some early initial runs, validating that the overall architecture converges with finite scalar quantization.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install magvit2-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
from magvit2_pytorch import (
    VideoTokenizer,
    VideoTokenizerTrainer
)

tokenizer = VideoTokenizer(
    image_size = 128,
    init_dim = 64,
    max_dim = 512,
    codebook_size = 1024,
    layers = (
        'residual',
        'compress_space',
        ('consecutive_residual', 2),
        'compress_space',
        ('consecutive_residual', 2),
        'linear_attend_space',
        'compress_space',
        ('consecutive_residual', 2),
        'attend_space',
        'compress_time',
        ('consecutive_residual', 2),
        'compress_time',
        ('consecutive_residual', 2),
        'attend_time',
    )
)

trainer = VideoTokenizerTrainer(
    tokenizer,
    dataset_folder = '/path/to/a/lot/of/media',     # folder of either videos or images, depending on setting below
    dataset_type = 'videos',                        # 'videos' or 'images', prior papers have shown pretraining on images to be effective for video synthesis
    batch_size = 4,
    grad_accum_every = 8,
    learning_rate = 2e-5,
    num_train_steps = 1_000_000
)

trainer.train()

# after a lot of training ...
# can use the EMA of the tokenizer

ema_tokenizer = trainer.ema_tokenizer

# mock video

video = torch.randn(1, 3, 17, 128, 128)

# tokenizing video to discrete codes

codes = ema_tokenizer.tokenize(video) # (1, 9, 16, 16) <- in this example, time downsampled by 4x and space downsampled by 8x. flatten token ids for (non)-autoregressive training

# sanity check

decoded_video = ema_tokenizer.decode_from_code_indices(codes)

assert torch.allclose(
    decoded_video,
    ema_tokenizer(video, return_recon = True)
)
```

To track your experiments on <a href="https://wandb.ai">Weights & Biases</a> set `use_wandb_tracking = True` on `VideoTokenizerTrainer`, and then use the `.trackers` context manager

```python

trainer = VideoTokenizerTrainer(
    use_wandb_tracking = True,
    ...
)

with trainer.trackers(project_name = 'magvit2', run_name = 'baseline'):
    trainer.train()

```

## Todo

- [ ] Magvit2 Tokenizer
    - [x] add adversarial loss
    - [x] implement the blurpool for antialiasing in discriminator
    - [x] LFQ should be able to pass loss breakdown (commitment and entropy), and forwarded to the return of the tokenizer
    - [x] add conditioning for encoder decoder with residual modulatable conv 3d
    - [x] `decode_from_codebook_indices` should be able to accept flattened ids and reshape to correct feature map dimensions and decode back to video
    - [x] add trainer and manage discriminator training
    - [x] add adaptive rmsnorm and conditionable transformer layers
    - [x] completely generalize to multiple discriminators at different time scales (taking inspiration of multi-resolution discriminators from soundstream)
        - [x] complete multiscale discriminator losses
        - [x] auto-manage multiscale discriminator optimizers
        - [ ] helper functions for crafting multi-resolution temporal discriminators (picking random consecutive frames)
    - [ ] add attention
        - [ ] use axial rotary embeddings for spatial
    - [ ] add an optional autoregressive loss at some penultimate layer of the decoder - check literature to see if anyone else has done this unification of transformer decoder + tokenizer in one architecture
- [ ] Improvise a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01941">RQ Video Transformer</a>, as residual LFQ actually makes sense now
